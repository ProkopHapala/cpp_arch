# Prokop's C++ program samples archive
archive of my small independent C++ programs

- most of the programs use [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) librady and OpenGL for visualization. 
- programs are compiled independently, using `make`; `Makefile` in each directory is configured for ubuntu linux ( tested on ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04 ) 
- in most of the programs typing `./test` would recompile and run the program
